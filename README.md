This project is an hardware project combined with IoT made during Project cycle of 2021-2022.

This is a system that can continuously monitor a patient's heart rate and detect any abnormal spikes or drops in their heart rate. The system would then alert the patient's family or caregiver in real-time, allowing them to take immediate action if necessary. This project has the potential to help save lives by providing real-time monitoring of a patient's heart rate and alerting their emergency contacts if there is a problem.

### Features

It is a health monitoring system which is used to check the heart rate of a person and if the person has high/low heartbeat and is on the verge of getting a heart attack, it automatically gives an emergency call, describing the patient's health conditions and requesting for ambulance.
